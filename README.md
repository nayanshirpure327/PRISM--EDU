##  Overview

**PRISM EDU** is a web-based student support and predictive analytics platform designed to help educational institutions identify students who may need support at an early stage.

The platform combines student academic and engagement data with machine learning insights, faculty intervention tools, AI-powered learning support, counselling support, scholarship information, and career opportunities.

### Core Objective

**Student Data → Predictive Analysis → Early Identification → Faculty Action → Student Support → Better Student Outcomes**

---

##  Problem Statement

Student dropout can be influenced by multiple factors such as academic performance, attendance, engagement, financial difficulties, and lack of timely support.

Traditional systems often store student information without converting it into actionable insights.

PRISM EDU addresses this gap by bringing student data, predictive analytics, faculty monitoring, and support services together in one platform.

---

##  Proposed Solution

PRISM EDU provides separate experiences for students, faculty, and administrators.

The system can use existing admission and academic information, continuously collect relevant student activity, and generate predictive insights that help faculty identify students who may require timely intervention.

Students can also access learning resources, AI assistance, counselling support, scholarships, and career opportunities.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Python 3.x
- Git
- Supabase project
- Required API credentials

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nayanshirpure327/PRISM--EDU.git
cd PRISM--EDU
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file and add the environment variables required by the project.

Example:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

> Never commit real API keys or passwords to GitHub.

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Run the ML Service

Navigate to the ML service directory and install its Python dependencies according to the project's requirements.

```bash
cd ml_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the FastAPI service using the command specified by the project configuration.

##  Data Privacy & Security

PRISM EDU handles sensitive student-related information, so privacy and controlled access are important.

Key considerations include:

- Role-based access
- Secure authentication
- Protected student information
- Input validation
- Secure API communication
- Controlled access to predictive insights
- Protection of API credentials

Predictive analytics should be treated as a **support signal**, not a guaranteed prediction of a student's future.

---

##  Predictive Analytics Approach

PRISM EDU uses machine learning to analyze relevant student information and identify patterns associated with dropout risk.

Potential data categories include:

- Admission information
- Academic performance
- Attendance
- Assignment and quiz performance
- Learning activity
- Engagement indicators
- Other authorized institutional data

The goal is to help faculty **identify students who may need attention early**, so appropriate support can be provided.

##  Model Improvement

```

Model retraining should use validated historical outcomes rather than retraining blindly after every individual student activity.
